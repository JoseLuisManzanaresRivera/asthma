## Main take a ways. 




We documented:  

1. **Asthma** incidence at a regional scale focusing on the **border region**. 

2. The relationship between a **chronic-high cost disease**<span class="nowrap"><span class="emojify">🤧</span> and enviromental-humand <span class="nowrap"><span class="emojify">🙈</span>caused exposition factors 🏭


## Analysis strengths:  


 * We use international comparable  indicators allowing binational montoring.  
 
 * We employ data with a local perspective based on **electronic health records.**

* Temporal perspective allowing to define a **trend in time**. We actually find **asthma** to be a growing health concern for the region.

Which indicates a persistent issue demanding the attention of public health authorities.  Evidence indicates a cases concentration peak in **2016** relative to the national scenario (LII=1.88).   

* Higher than the national morbidity rates for the border and coal mining regions:   **9.2 vs. 15  per  100 000 pop**. 

* Evidence suggest the existence of a **hot spot** 📍 of **asthma** in the **desert region** ️🏜️  as well as the **Laguna region**  The former assosated to desert dust (the highest concentration of PM<sub>10</sub> )and the latter associated to the highest emissions of **Ammonia**.  NH<sub>3</sub> A quimical element found as a result of the economic activity of the region which includes **agro food and dairy industries 🐄**. (Use as **fertilizers**).
