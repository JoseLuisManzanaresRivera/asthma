* Environmental **justice**  (strong social component)

* Social implications: High social costs for families, including school absenteeism and productivity losses. 

* Expensive out of pocket treatment cost reaching annual $1,600 USD expenditures.

* Lack of health care coverage and access to medical treatment for low income families.
