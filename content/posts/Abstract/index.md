title: Externalidades negativas de la actividad econ√≥mica en la frontera Coahuila-Texas. El caso de egresos hospitalarios a causa de asma
---

# Abstract 

The work analyzes spatial and temporal patterns of hospital discharges due to asthma classified under codes **J450**, (predominantly allergic asthma) **J451** (non-allergic asthma), **J458** (Mixed athma) and **J459** (unspecified) of the International Classification of diseases (ICD-10).


## Geographic scale. 

The study is conducted for a region on the **Mexico-United States border** characterized by **coal** mining activity and **electricity generation**. These activities are associated with high atmospheric emissions of sulfur dioxide **(SO2)** and nitrogen oxides **(NOx)**, both known triggers for respiratory illnesses.

## Temporal scope. 

Covering eighteen years of data from **2004** to **2022** (the most up to date available public release of data). 

## Methodology and data sources

**Quantitative** analysis based on publicly available **electronic morbidity records** from the  *National System of health information*  [SINAIS](http://www.dgis.salud.gob.mx/contenidos/basesdedatos/bdc_egresoshosp_gobmx.html)

We estimate indicators of relative concentration and age structure adjusted **morbidity rates** for the state and the **five regions** within Coahuila.
